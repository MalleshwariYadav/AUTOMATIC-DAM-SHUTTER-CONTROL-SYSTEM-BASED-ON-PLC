# AUTOMATIC-DAM-SHUTTER-CONTROL-SYSTEM-BASED-ON-PLC
The Automatic Dam Shutter Control System Based on PLC is an Industrial automation project designed to control the opening and closing of dam shutters based on real-time water level conditions. Water level sensors continuously send inputs to a Programmable Logic Controller, which processes the data using ladder logic and operates the shutter mechanism accordingly to prevent flooding and reduce manual intervention.
The control logic includes threshold-based decision making, safety interlocking, and optional manual or emergency override to ensure reliable and secure operation. The system is implemented using a PLC, water level sensors, DC motors, motor driver circuitry, and PLC programming software, and can be demonstrated using a small-scale dam prototype. This project highlights the practical application of PLCs in automation and safety-critical control systems relevant to industrial and academic environments.
